      <h1>Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar</h1>

      <p>
        Kendrick Lamar's "Duckworth", is the final track on Kendrick Lamar's
        album DAMN. It tells the story of a cricital encounter between Kendrick
        Lamar's father aka Ducky, and Anthony Tiffith aka "Top Dawg", the future
        CEO of Lamar's record label. Years before Lamar's birth, Ducky worked at
        a KFC and showed kindness to at the time gang member Tiffith, by giving
        him extra food, which led Tiffith to spare Ducky's life during a
        robbery. This act of kindness eventually led to Tiffith discovering and
        signing Kendrick Lamar, changing his life forever. The song protrays how
        small acts can have big impacts, shaping lives in unexpected ways.

        <li>Darling, I told you many times</li>
        <li>And I am telling you once again</li>
        <li>Just to remind you, sweetheart</li>

      <h4 id="verse" class="lyrics">Verse</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Oh, Lamar</li>
        <li>Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard</li>
        <li>Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark</li>
        <li>Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star</li>
        <li>Life is one funny ma'fucker</li>
        <li>A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him</li>
        <li>I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep</li>
        <li>Introverted by my thoughts, children, listen, it gets deep</li>
        <li>See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects</li>
        <li>The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect</li>
        <li>Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot</li>
        <li>Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals</li>
        <li>Anthony was the oldest of seven</li>
        <li>Well-respected, calm and collected</li>
        <li>Laughin' and jokin' made life easier, hard times, mama on crack</li>
        <li>A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her</li>
        <li>His family history: pimpin' and bangin'</li>
        <li>
          He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
        </li>
        <li>Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces</li>
        <li>Even got some head from a smoker last weekend</li>
        <li>Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie</li>
        <li>Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him</li>
        <li>
          Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
        </li>
        <li>Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies</li>
        <li>Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case</li>
        <li>
          Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
        </li>
        <li>hat was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin</li>
        <li>He beat the case and went back to hustlin'</li>
        <li>Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang</li>
        <li>
          The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing
        </li>
        <li>They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots</li>
        <li>And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks</li>
        <li>Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it</li>
        <li>
          He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
        </li>
        <li>
          See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked
          a lot
        </li>
        <li>With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window</li>
        <li>
          His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
        </li>
        <li>Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome</li>
        <li>
          Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
        </li>
        <li>They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college</li>
        <li>Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it</li>
        <li>Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends</li>
        <li>Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket</li>
        <li>'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it</li>
        <li>Stuck up the place before, back in '84</li>
        <li>That's when affiliation was really at gears of war</li>
        <li>
          So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us,
          crime
        </li>
        <li>Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's</li>
        <li>Ducky was well-aware</li>
        <li>They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year</li>
        <li>He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides</li>
        <li>
          Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
        </li>
        <li>Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him</li>
        <li>
          In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
        </li>
        <li>
          That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
        </li>
        <li>Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why</li>
        <li>You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments</li>
        <li>
          Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
        </li>
        <li>
          Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
        </li>
        <li>Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits</li>
        <li>Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident</li>
        <li>Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?</li>
        <li>Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life</li>
        <li>While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight</li>
        <li>*Gunshot*</li>
